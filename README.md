# Burger-Studio-Game
### A Java GUI game
Given a list of ingredients for a burger, the player must catch the right
ingredients on a bun as they fall from the sky to make a perfect burger!
You have three chances to make a mistake before its game over :0

Controls: left and right arrow keys

I created all the images with Photoshop.
